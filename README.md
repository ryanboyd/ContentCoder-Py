# Content Coder
A very, very generic implementation of a dictionary-based content coder. This is an example of how to do a (relatively) efficient content coding mechanism that allows for multi-word phrases, wildcards at any point in a dictionary entry, and converting between various LIWC dictionary formats.

Additionally, there are a number of "quality of life" features here as well, such as the ability to export dictionaries, and dictionary results, in various formats, the ability to add/drop categories and words, and use term weights for scoring.


# Notes
This codebase is a public fork of a private codebase that was authored by — and is the intellectual property of — Ryan L. Boyd. The original code was written between 2020 and 2021; the primary difference between this and the original codebase is that several project-specific functions have been removed to keep this code as "general purpose" as possible.
